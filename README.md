# The Defence Digital Service Way (The DDS Way)

[The DDS Way](https://defencedigital.github.io/dds-way/)

Built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the 
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.

The Main branch is where the Markdown files are stored, and then GitHub Actions
will create the static content and push to the gh-pages branch which is where
GitHub Pages then publishes it at the link [here](https://defencedigital.github.io/dds-way/)
