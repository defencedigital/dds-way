# The DDS Way

The DDS Way documents the specific technology, tools and processes that Defence Digital Service teams use to build and operate services.

Itâ€™s not intended as guidance for anyone working outside DDS. 

This is based on the [GDS Way](https://gds-way.cloudapps.digital/)

## About The DDS Way

The DDS Way shares agreed ways of working so service teams benefit from:

* using similar tools
* central procurement
* costs savings as new teams will be cheaper to spin up

The DDS Way makes it easier for projects to get started while still giving teams flexibility to do something different if their project needs it.

The DDS Way includes consistent:

* terminology
* ways of working
* technology and tools
* measures

All decisions are made in alignment with [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) which covers service design more broadly.

Products at DDS in discovery or alpha development phases must follow [agile delivery principles](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) and also have the option to follow the standards in this repository.

Products in beta and live phases must follow both the instructions set out in the Service Manual and the standards in this repository.

## How to add new guidance

Contribute to this repository by making a pull request in [GitHub](https://github.com/defencedigital/dds-way) for discussion at the DDS Way Forum.

You can also read the service manual to find out about
[learning about and writing user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs).

Thank you for your contributions as we develop this repository.

## The DDS Way Forum

This site documents some of the decisions agreed at the DDS Way Forum about the products we operate.

The DDS Forum meets once a month. The Forum is lead developers and technical architects representing DDS projects who are responsible for communicating and implementing the DDS Way.

The Forum reviews:

* all DDS Way open and closed PRs
* expired guidance and if it should be continued
* possible subject areas and ownership of new content
